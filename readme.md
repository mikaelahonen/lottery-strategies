# Compare two lottery strategies
Is it more probable to win in a lottery if you:
a) Do one row of lottery each week next 50 years
b) Do equal number of lottery rows for a single draw

## The lottery strategy experiment
The b) is better strategy in theory, but practical difference is insignificant.

In the analysis it is assumed that multiple lottery wins won't bring additional value.

Finnish lottery system has been used in the experiment. There are 40 numbers in total from which you should select 7.

## Analysis notebook
The results are in the jupyter notebook `compare-lottery-strategies.ipynb`.
